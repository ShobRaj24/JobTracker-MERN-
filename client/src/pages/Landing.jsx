            A Job Tracking Application helps users efficiently manage their job
            search by organizing applications, tracking their status, and
            scheduling interviews. It provides features like logging job
            details, monitoring progress (e.g., applied, interview, offer), and
            setting reminders for interviews or follow-ups. The application
            offers a streamlined experience for tracking multiple job
            opportunities, keeping users organized and informed throughout the
            job search process.
